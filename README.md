This was a challenge given by MURF.AI team to create a innovative project that uses MURF TTS API as a solution. 

What it is?
It acts as a personal agent and resolves user queries with its capability to understand what's on the user current screen. 

How it works?

It is a chrome extension, where a user can activate their personal web-page agent to answer for their queries just by expressing the question in audio format. The same way the agent responds with the solution in audio format to the user query. 
The text response was generated by and LLM -and converted to speech using MURF TTS API. 

Conclusion

The final goal was to help users as a Vision based voice assistant on their web pages for instant solution.
